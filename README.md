# Work Day Scheduler


## Background

In this project, I was asked to make a work-day scheduler that the employees can add important events to a daily planner thus, people can manage their time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

There are some criteria that need to be met in order to establish the planner that is the most effective for the users and these are:
1. When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
3. When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event
5. When I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage
6. When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
